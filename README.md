# 🧠 ZK Quest — Your Battle for ZK Server Stability!

ZK Quest is a browser-based game where you play as the defender of a Zero Knowledge service. Correct buttons represent legitimate user requests like ZKP, PROOF, SIGNAL, while wrong buttons are bugs and attacks that overload the server. Be careful: 3 mistakes and your server crashes!

## 🎮 Gameplay

👆 Your goal is to click only on the correct buttons as they appear on the screen.

🛑 Click 3 wrong buttons (bugs, attacks) — and you lose.

⚠️ Miss 2 buttons (right buttons) — and you also lose. They’ll fly off-screen, so stay alert!
